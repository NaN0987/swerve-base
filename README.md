# swerve-base

This is a template used by 308 and 7178 for programming swerve drive for FRC. This template was originally built off of the
MaxSwerve template code (which is why there's a license from Rev) and has been modified to work with MK4/MK4i swerve modules with NEOs, SRX Mag Encoders, and 
a NavX.

## Features
- Field-centric drive
- Odometry pose estimation
- Limelight 3 support
- Pathplanner support
